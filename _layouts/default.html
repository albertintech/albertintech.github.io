    <h2>The Usual Suspects</h2>

    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit at least a billion people, and probably more. Albert Ramos is a <strike>guinea pig</strike>, er, student of Learn Enough to Be Dangerous.

            Known for his dazzling charm, and rapier wit,
            Michael is the creator of the
            <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails
            Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
            <a href="https://learnenough.com/">
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence. His status as a secret supervillain remain unconfirmed.

            When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

            You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.

            Being enamored by "the great indoors," as he likes to call it, you can find Albert enjoying a fine coffee while reading or working some Ruby voodoo over his laptop at random cafes. He also enjoys languages and is currently learning Japanese.
